## Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: Why do I get validation warnings?**
- Your file may have formatting issues (e.g., misplaced `!!`, missing priorities). Run `taskmasterra validate -i todo.md` for details.

**Q: How do I archive completed tasks?**
- When you run `taskmasterra recordkeep -i todo.md`. Completed tasks are moved to the archive file with a timestamp.

**Q: Can I use this on Windows/Linux?**
- Most features work cross-platform, but Reminders integration is macOS-only.

**Q: How do I customize priorities or effort values?**
- Priorities are A/B/C/D. Effort is Fibonacci (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89). These are not currently customizable.
