- high level, BRAINSTORM, business project ideas
  No need for realistic goals.
  Something solo or at least remote team members.
  Nothing requiring sales, sells self.
  consider wrapping/combining existing open source tools.
  solve "simple" problems that others find difficult.
- private network, family vpn that just works
- better org and org-roam that just works
- quality framework that just works
- some variant of fediverse application
  - \*notes
    - blog
  - \*second brain
    - secure
  - \*private gathering blog/social/planning/sharing
    - ? with verified (ie blockchain) identities and mojo scores
  - \*? with home automation tie-ins
    - ? combined with private network/family vpn idea
- Developers tools
  - a better text editor
  - an add-on for an existing editor(s)
- Systems Engineer tools
- outmind. map/outliner.
  - choose tools that are protocols over tools that may change (version upgrades, e.g. node and webdriver.io)
  - research db
    - would lynx be a useful cli front end for a roguelike interface? This would make the ui html, so a protocol dependency not a specific tool dependency.
  - research ui
  - \*research ?
  - architecture
    - ?json|toml|yaml? object (structure so I can write a document that is then represented in a gui/tui, and vice-versa)
    - has a hashmap of {documents it is in: {position-in-document, connections-other-objects, tags, text, text-color shape, color}}
